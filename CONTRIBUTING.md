# Contributing

Contributing to the project is simple. Just do the following:

1. Be nice :)

2. If you are not sure about something (e.g. if something is a bug, on how to solve it, if a feature makes sense etc.),
   before starting to work on it, create an issue for it, so that we can discuss beforehand - maybe saving your time.

3. Fork the repo, do your changes, create a PR.

4. Make sure the build succeeds. Do the changes from after the review if needed.

That's it.
